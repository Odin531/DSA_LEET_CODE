# DSA_LEET_CODE
this repo will contain mostly all the question who's best approach I at the best of my ability have found.

# Two_sum
in this i have treid the two pointer approach. 
1234567 if this  the vector then to find the numbers whos sum is let say 10 we go like this 
a[0]+a[6]=8<10;
a[1]+a[6]=9<10;
a[2]+a[6]=10==10 found now return {2,6}.
remember this will only work if the array or vector is  sorted.
